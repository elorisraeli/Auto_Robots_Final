# The final project of the course Autonomous Robots. #


Topic number 3 that we have chosen is about:

"Android-based remote vehicle control technology requires familiarization and testing of any vehicle that will be provided to you - for this task you must use the ANDRUAV application and will be connected to a flight controller and drive a vehicle."

## Actual task:

Look at an application like ANDRUAV that actually allows a phone like Android to connect to a flight controller and then fly a drone or a car or a boat with it, etc.
The drones are more complicated and there are no boats, so we will go more in the direction of vehicles.
The idea - I have a phone and I want this phone to drive well. where? In some small route or on-rouad or off-rouad.

### Short review on our previous works ###

We haven't work about something like drone projects or any other auto robots before.

The only previous work in connection to that is the other projects (tasks) from this course:
- First: https://github.com/roy-asraf1/Autonomous-robots -> GNSS Data Processing and Position Calculation.
- Second: https://github.com/roy-asraf1/Autonomous-robots_1 -> Auto Drone Algorithm
