# The final project of the course Autonomous Robots. #


Topic number 4 that we have chosen is about:

Initial introduction and development of the DJI Mobile SDK development environment,
in particular work on the ability to plan a real-time mission with the help of moving the navigation target point 
(it is possible to assume the use of GPS for location).

### Short review on our previous works ###

We haven't work about something like drone projects or any other auto robots before.

The only previous work in connection to that is the other projects (tasks) from this course:
- First: https://github.com/roy-asraf1/Autonomous-robots -> GNSS Data Processing and Position Calculation.
- Second: https://github.com/roy-asraf1/Autonomous-robots_1 -> Auto Drone Algorithm
